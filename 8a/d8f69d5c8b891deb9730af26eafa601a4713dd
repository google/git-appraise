{"timestamp":"1591227247","reviewRef":"refs/pull/102/head","targetRef":"refs/heads/master","requester":"ojarjur","description":" Add support for detached comments\n\nThis change adds support for \"detached\" comments; comments that are not attached to a code review.\r\n\r\nInstead, we anchor these comments at a file path relative to the repository.\r\n\r\nIn order to do that, we add the concept of a \"well-known commit\" which can be deterministically recreated and corresponds to a specific path. Detached comments are then attached to their corresponding well-known commit rather than a review.\r\n\r\nWhen we use a well-known commit for the first time, we add it to the archive ref so that the attached git-notes do not get pruned. To prevent the archive ref from growing indefinitely, this change also includes an enhancement where trying to archive an already-archived object is a no-op.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #97 ","baseCommit":"480fd8a4b8a03993fefaf2ea47db68d1cebf63f6"}
