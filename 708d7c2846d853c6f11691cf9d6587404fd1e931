{"timestamp":"1453990916","author":"jishi9","description":"I noticed that the submit command will fail silently (exit status 1, but no error message) if the config key `appraise.submit` doesn't exist or was set to a bad value (other than \"merge\" or \"rebase\"). I arrived at this state by running these commands on a branch:\r\n```\r\ngit appraise request\r\ngit appraise comment -lgtm\r\ngit appraise submit \r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the reason no error message is being displayed is because `git config` doesn't display an error message for a missing config key.\r\n\r\nWe will need to check the exit code of `git config`; according to the docs, an exit code of 1 for `git config` means \"the section or key is invalid\".\r\n\r\nWe also need to check that that the retrieved config value is one of 'merge' or 'rebase'"}
