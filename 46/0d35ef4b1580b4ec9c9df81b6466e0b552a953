The tool tries to read the history of the review requests from the note, so we want to keep all of the previous requests around too.\r\n2. Editing a note (rather than appending to it) can effectively wind up appending if you push or pull notes to a remote. The reason is that the notes from the remote get merged with the edited note using the cat_sort_uniq strategy, so every line from both ends up in the merged note."}
