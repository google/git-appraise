# Git Code Review Tool

This repo contains a command line tool for performing code reviews on git
repositories.

## Installation

Assuming you have the [Go tools installed](https://golang.org/doc/install), run
the following command:

    go get source.developers.google.com/id/0tH0wAQFren.git/git-review

Then, to add "review" git alias, run the following command.

    git config --global alias.review "!git-review"

## Requirements

This tool expects to run in an environment with the following attributes:

1.  The git command line tool is installed, and included in the PATH.
2.  The tool is run from within a git repo.
3.  The git command line tool is configured with the credentials it needs to
    push to and pull from the remote repos.

## Usage

Requesting a code review:

    git review request

Pushing code reviews to a remote:

    git review push [<remote>]

Pulling code reviews from a remote:

    git review pull [<remote>]

Listing open code reviews:

    git review list

Showing the status of the current review, including comments:

    git review show

Commenting on a review:

    git review comment -m "<message>" [<file> [<line>]]

Accepting the changes in a review:

    git review accept [-m "<message>"]

Submitting a review:

    git review submit [--merge | --rebase]

Continuously push and pull reviews to/from a remote:

    git review sync [<remote>]

## Metadata

The code review data is stored in git-notes, using the formats described below.
Each item stored is written as a single line of JSON, and is written with at
most one such item per line. This allows the git notes to be automatically
merged using the "cat\_sort\_uniq" strategy.

Since these notes are not in a human-friendly form, all of the refs used to
track them start with the prefix "refs/notes/devtools". This helps make it
clear that these are meant to be read and written by automated tools.

### Code Review Requests

Code review requests are stored in the "refs/notes/devtools/reviews" ref, and
annotate the first revision in a review. They must conform to the following
schema.

    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "reviewRef": {
          "id": "reviewRef",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "targetRef": {
          "id": "targetRef",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "requester": {
          "type": "string"
        }
        "reviewers": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "description": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "targetRef"
      ]
    }

The "reviewRef" field is used to specify a git ref that tracks the current
revision under review, and the "targetRef" field is used to specify the git ref
that should be updated once the review is approved.

### Robot Comments

Robot comments are comments generated by static analysis tools. These are
stored in the "refs/notes/devtools/analyses" ref, and annotate the revision.
They must confirm to the following schema, which is taken from the Note
protocol buffer message defined
[here](https://github.com/google/shipshape/blob/master/shipshape/proto/note.proto).

    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "path": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "range": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "startLine": {
                  "type": "integer"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "category": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "description": {
          "id": "description",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "description"
      ]
    }

### Review Comments

Review comments are comments that were written by a person rather than by a
machine. These are stored in the "refs/notes/devtools/discuss" ref, and
annotate the first revision in the review. They must confirm to the following
schema.

    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "author": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "parent": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "location": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "commit": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "path": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "range": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "startLine": {
                  "type": "integer"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "description": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "resolved": {
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      }
    }

When the parent is specified, it must be the SHA1 hash of another comment on
the same revision, and it means this comment is a reply to that comment.

The timestamp field represents the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, and
is formatted as a 10 digit decimal number with zero padding. It should be the
first field written, so that the lexicographical ordering of comments matches
their chronological ordering.
