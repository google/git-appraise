{"timestamp":"1660166127","author":"ojarjur","description":"Hi @iveqy, thanks for taking the time and putting in the effort to contribute to the tool.\r\n\r\nAs you noted, there is more to what is going on than just the `IsAncestor` check.\r\n\r\nWhen you rebase the commits in a review outside of using the `git appraise rebase` command, then we lose any link between the original commit and the commit you are trying to submit.\r\n\r\nThat means that even if we disabled the `IsAncestor` check, the original review would not show up as being submitted, because git-appraise does not know the commits are related.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by running `git appraise rebase` prior to running `git appraise submit`, so maybe instead all we need to do is catch this scenario and give the user appropriate instructions.\r\n\r\nI'll add an inline comment giving an example of what I am thinking."}
