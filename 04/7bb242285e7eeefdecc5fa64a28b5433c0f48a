It can become impossible to submit\r\nwith the error message:\r\n\r\nRefusing to submit a non-fast-forward review. First merge the target\r\nref.\r\n\r\nthis even if the review ref is a ancestor of the target ref and the\r\nmerge should been a fast forward merge. This is because the check for\r\nappraise submit is done against the first commit sha1 that was used and\r\nnot for the actually reviewRef that will be merged. This fixes that.","baseCommit":"99aeb0e71544d3e1952e208c339b1aec70968cf3"}
