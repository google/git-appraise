As such, we also assumed that they would have\nthe review ref checked out locally, and only supported submitting the\ncurrent review.\n\nHowever, with pull requests the author of a change may not have\npermission to submit it. Instead, the review would be submitted by one\nof its reviewers. To make this easy, this change adds the ability to\nspecify the hash of the review to submit, and performs the submit flow\nwithout checking out the review ref locally.","baseCommit":"3a425d2410dda80faca5b284515d292247cd6b90"}
