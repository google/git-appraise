Either way they're both perfectly valid questions, so I'll answer both.\r\n\r\n1) `submit` is one subcommand that deals with both closing the code review (changing it from 'accepted'), and the way in which the code is actually merged. So with this subcommand you may use `--merge` or `--rebase` or `--fast-forward`, or you may configure this globally within the scope of your project. By default it will use fast-forward.

The focus with git-appraise is to close (submit) the review along with the code. So rather than having 3 subcommands to submit the review we just use `submit` and optionally allow the flags at stated above.\r\n\r\nThese are just my opinions on two of the points you brought up. I hope this provides some insight. :)"}

Although the code is very much tied to the review itself, it is the review we are submitting and as a result of that the code is then merged.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it just based on the terms alone, \"merging a review\" doesn't really make much sense, where as submitting one does. Again, it's contextual."}
