It is the same as \"git rev-list\" with\nthe \"--exclude=\u003cfrom\u003e\" argument, but calling it anything based\non \"rev-list\" would be both cumbersome and misleading (since\n\"rev-list\" is a much more general command).\n\nRegardless, I've taken another pass at the godoc to try to\nmake that more clear.\n\nPTAL"}
