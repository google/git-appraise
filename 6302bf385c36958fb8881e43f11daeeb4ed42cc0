{"timestamp":"1449704245","reviewRef":"refs/heads/ojarjur/populate-default-merge-message","targetRef":"refs/heads/master","requester":"ojarjur@google.com","reviewers":["ckerur@google.com","amshali@google.com"],"description":"Populate the default commit message when submitting a review with the --merge option.\n\nThe \"git appraise submit\" command supports a \"--merge\" option, that forces the\ncreation of a merge commit for the review (sometimes called a \"merge bubble\").\n\nWhen this is done, an editor is launched for the user to provide the message\nfor that merge commit. Previously, the editor was being populated with the\ndefault message which has the form \"merge branch ... with ...\". This change\nreplaces that with a more appropriate message that specifies the review\nbeing submitted, and the description of that review.\n\nThis is important in that a user may want to use merge commits to allow\nthemselves to both maintain a full history of their changes (including changes\nmade in response to review feedback) and have the ability to list only the\nhigh level changes corresponding to the submission of each review.\n\nMore specifically, if a user wants to always submit their reviews with the\n--merge option, then this change makes it so that they can use the command\n\"git log --first-parent\" to view only the portion of their history that\ncorresponds to review submissions, while still having the displayed messages\nprovide a meaningful summary of the change.","baseCommit":"d9f03ea9eaa7a36b7d3116a7a48cc88e8dbb164c"}
