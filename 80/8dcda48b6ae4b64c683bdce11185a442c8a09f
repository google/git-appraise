I'm currently leaning toward the opinion that we can't really win, so we have to go with the least-bad option.\r\n\r\nI think that we should still keep the `list` subcommand, and that `git appraise` should not support all of the flags that `git appraise list` supports. The reason I lean towards that is because it:\r\n\r\n1. Will make the default behavior applicable more often (i.e. I want to list the open reviews very frequently, but very rarely want to see the help text).\r\n2. Will save us from having to make the default help text very complicated (i.e. the list flags only have to be shown in the output of `git appraise help list`).\r\n\r\nThat corresponds with the change you have right now, so I agree with your current proposal.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this approach is that we now have two ways to list the open reviews (`git appraise` and `git appraise list`). However, the same can be said for listing branches (`git branch` and `git branch --list`), so I guess we are at least being somewhat consistent with the git interface.\r\n\r\nWe should probably also update the default help message so that it explains that we list open reviews by default."}
