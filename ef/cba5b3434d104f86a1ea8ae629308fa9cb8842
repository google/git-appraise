That means the\ncall to `git appraise request` will not see that existing review, and\ninstead of updating it will create a new review anchored at the new\ncommit.\n\nMy current thinking is that we should extend the `request` subcommand\nto optionally take the commit hash at which to anchor the review. That\nwould then allow the user to update a request after rebasing by adding\nthe hash of the original commit as an argument to the `request` command.\n","resolved":false}
