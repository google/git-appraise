Adding a new `refs/archives/devtools` ref that can be used to make sure that commits which have been rebased do not get garbage collected.\r\n2. Adding a new `alias` field to the request schema that enables tracking review history across rebases.\r\n3. Adding a new `rebase` subcommand that enables us to update the history for a change prior to submitting it.","baseCommit":"7e4f4b3e76d1fa1966b40c480a38dae0fdf9af8a"}
