Do not return a nil error from `getSummaryFromNotes` if the returned\r\n   summary is nil, as that breaks assumptions made by callers that one\r\n   of the two return values must be non-nil.\r\n2. Proactively check that the specified hash exists and points to a commit\r\n   object before trying to load a review attached to that commit.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these two changes fixes #73\r\n\r\nThe first change prevents the tool from panicing on a bad input, while\r\nthe second change makes the error message presented to the user easier\r\nto understand and fix.","baseCommit":"cf3a505d71afe602808eaf9ebba2b66021fe16f9"}
