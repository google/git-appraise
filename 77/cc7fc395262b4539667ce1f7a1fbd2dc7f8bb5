The usage strings for every command follow a consistent format.\n2. The \"comment\" command now takes the file and line as flags, and allows\n   the review hash to be provided as a positional argument.\n\nThe change to the \"comment\" command is backwards-incompatible. Scripts\nthat relied on being able to pass the file and line number as positional\narguments will no longer work with this new version.\n\nTo mitigate the issues with that; the previous commit has been tagged\nas version \"v0.1\", so that users who need the previous behavior can always\ninstall the older version of the tool.","baseCommit":"87cddd6f041f3432ca70fd84b22f8a3993c0bdd5"}
