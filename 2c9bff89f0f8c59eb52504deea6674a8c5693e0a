However, that winds up just being something of the form\n\"exit status 128\", with all of the real error message going to the\nStderr field.\n\nAs such, this commit changes the behavior to save the data written to\nstderr, and use it to construct a new error to return.","baseCommit":"6302bf385c36958fb8881e43f11daeeb4ed42cc0"}
