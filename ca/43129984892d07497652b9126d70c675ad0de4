These\r\nare represented in the JSON format using a new \"original\" field that\r\nreferences the original, unedited comment.\r\n\r\nBy default, when displaying a comment thread that has been edited,\r\nonly the current version of comment is displayed. The full history of\r\nthe comment can be viewed by adding the `--json` flag to the\r\n`git appraise show` command, to display the review in JSON format.\r\n\r\nThis change defines how edits are represented in git-notes and makes\r\nthe tool properly display edited comments, but does not add any support\r\nto the tool for creating edits.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #67","baseCommit":"0cd354abd8775c9b06ed47d84dbd7983649c01ed"}
